## Overview

**Project Title**: Produce Store

**Project Description**: This program allows the store to record sales and use a database to keep track of its inventory and produce.This includes adding new products and removing old ones.

**Project Goals**: I want to be able to create a strong clean and functional database to store the data. One of my big goals for this sprint is to split up the project into smaller more manageable parts so that I donâ€™t get overwhelmed.

5. Remove a product from the database
6.  Exit the program
